In the **Raft consensus algorithm**, `AppendEntries` RPCs are the primary mechanism for log replication. Let's break it down from a developer's POV, especially with a focus on how and when these RPCs are sent and when commits should happen.

### 🔄 **When does the leader send `AppendEntries` RPCs?**

1. **Immediately after becoming the leader**:

   - The leader **sends empty `AppendEntries`** (heartbeats) to all followers to assert leadership.

2. **Periodically (Heartbeat)**:

   - A leader sends **empty `AppendEntries` every heartbeat interval** (say, 50–150ms) even if no new log entries are available — just to maintain authority and check liveness of followers.

3. **When a new command is received from a client**:

   - The leader **appends the command to its local log** and then **sends `AppendEntries`** containing the new log entry to the followers.

4. **On retry due to failure**:
   - If an `AppendEntries` fails due to log inconsistency (e.g., follower’s log is behind), the leader retries with decremented `nextIndex` to backtrack and find a match.

### ✅ **When should commit happen?**

1. **What does "commit" mean in Raft?**

   - An entry is **committed** when it’s known to be **replicated on a majority of servers**, and:
   - It’s part of the **current term** (important nuance).

2. **Conditions for a leader to commit a log entry**:

   - The leader tracks the **matchIndex[]** for each follower (i.e., the highest log index known to be replicated).
   - It then **finds the highest index `N` such that:**
     - `N > commitIndex`
     - A majority of matchIndex[i] ≥ `N`
     - `log[N].term == currentTerm` ← this prevents commitment of stale entries from previous terms.

3. **Once committed**:
   - The leader applies the entry to its state machine.
   - The next `AppendEntries` will **include the updated `leaderCommit` index**, so followers know to apply the entry too.

### 🔍 Developer Tip (based on your expertise):

If you're building or debugging Raft:

- `AppendEntries` isn't just about sending log entries — it's the **heartbeat, commit signal, and recovery mechanism** rolled into one.
- Commit decisions should only be made by the **leader**, and must satisfy the quorum condition + current term requirement.
- **Followers only commit up to the `leaderCommit` index** sent in the `AppendEntries` — they never make the commit decision themselves.
