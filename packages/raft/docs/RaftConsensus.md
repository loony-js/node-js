Sure! Given your experience, I’ll outline the **Raft consensus algorithm implementation steps** from a **developer's perspective**, using your background with **TypeScript, Rust, and backend systems**. Raft breaks consensus into three subproblems:

1. **Leader election**
2. **Log replication**
3. **Safety (commits in order, no conflicts)**

Let’s walk through the steps of implementing Raft with those parts in mind:

---

### 🧱 1. Define Raft Node State

Each node (peer) maintains the following persistent and volatile state:

#### Persistent (saved to disk):

```ts
term: number           // latest term server has seen
votedFor: string|null  // candidateId that received vote in current term
log: LogEntry[]        // list of log entries
```

#### Volatile (in-memory):

```ts
commitIndex: number // highest log entry known to be committed
lastApplied: number // highest log entry applied to state machine
```

#### For leader only:

```ts
nextIndex: Record<PeerId, number>
matchIndex: Record<PeerId, number>
```

---

### ⚙️ 2. State Machine & Transitions

Each node is always in one of these states:

- **Follower**
- **Candidate**
- **Leader**

Use an internal state machine to handle transitions.

```ts
enum NodeRole {
  Follower,
  Candidate,
  Leader,
}
```

Use timers to trigger:

- **Election timeout** (starts election)
- **Heartbeat interval** (leader sends heartbeats)

---

### 🗳️ 3. Leader Election

#### a. Start election (triggered by election timeout):

```ts
increment currentTerm
vote for self
reset election timer
send RequestVote RPCs to all other servers
```

#### b. On receiving `RequestVote`:

```ts
grant vote if:
- candidate’s term ≥ currentTerm
- haven’t voted yet in this term or voted for candidate
- candidate’s log is at least as up-to-date
```

#### c. On receiving majority votes → become Leader

---

### 📦 4. Log Replication (AppendEntries RPC)

#### a. Leader responsibilities:

- Append new commands from client to its log
- Send `AppendEntries` RPCs (including heartbeats) to followers
- If majority confirms, mark entries as committed

#### b. On receiving `AppendEntries`:

```ts
- reject if term < currentTerm
- if log inconsistency, reject and send back the index to fix
- if match, append new entries
- update commitIndex
```

#### c. Followers apply committed entries to state machine

---

### 🔒 5. Safety Rules

- Logs must be consistent across all nodes (same prefix)
- Only entries from **current term** can be committed via majority
- Use a mechanism to truncate or backtrack logs to match leader

---

### 🔁 6. Communication

Implement RPC-like messaging (can use HTTP, TCP, or gRPC). Define message types:

```ts
// RequestVote
{
  term: number,
  candidateId: string,
  lastLogIndex: number,
  lastLogTerm: number
}

// AppendEntries
{
  term: number,
  leaderId: string,
  prevLogIndex: number,
  prevLogTerm: number,
  entries: LogEntry[],
  leaderCommit: number
}
```

---

### 🧪 7. Testing & Simulation

- Build unit tests for each state machine transition
- Add failure injection (node crash, network partition)
- Use logs to verify consistency, leader election, etc.
