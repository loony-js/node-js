Absolutely! With your `aegis` and `aegis_key_value` tables, **joins are very useful** to combine data from both tables, since `aegis_key_value.aegis_id` references `aegis.uid`. Let’s go through the common types:

---

### **1. Inner Join**

Returns only rows that have matching entries in both tables.

```sql
SELECT
    a.uid AS aegis_id,
    a.name AS aegis_name,
    kv.key,
    kv.value
FROM aegis a
INNER JOIN aegis_key_value kv
    ON a.uid = kv.aegis_id;
```

✅ Example output:

| aegis_id | aegis_name    | key   | value |
| -------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1        | Example Aegis | color | blue  |

---

### **2. Left Join**

Returns all `aegis` rows, even if there’s no matching key-value.

```sql
SELECT
    a.uid AS aegis_id,
    a.name AS aegis_name,
    kv.key,
    kv.value
FROM aegis a
LEFT JOIN aegis_key_value kv
    ON a.uid = kv.aegis_id;
```

- If an `aegis` has no key-value, `kv.key` and `kv.value` will be `NULL`.

---

### **3. Filtering with Joins**

You can combine `JOIN` with `WHERE` to get specific results. For example, find all `aegis` entries where `color = 'blue'`:

```sql
SELECT
    a.uid AS aegis_id,
    a.name AS aegis_name,
    kv.key,
    kv.value
FROM aegis a
INNER JOIN aegis_key_value kv
    ON a.uid = kv.aegis_id
WHERE kv.key = 'color' AND kv.value = 'blue';
```

---

### **4. Aggregate Example**

Count how many key-value pairs each `aegis` has:

```sql
SELECT
    a.uid AS aegis_id,
    a.name AS aegis_name,
    COUNT(kv.uid) AS kv_count
FROM aegis a
LEFT JOIN aegis_key_value kv
    ON a.uid = kv.aegis_id
GROUP BY a.uid, a.name;
```

---

If you want, I can **write a single “all-in-one” query** that returns each `aegis` with **all its key-value pairs in a JSON array**, which is super handy for APIs.

Do you want me to do that?
