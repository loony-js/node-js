Sure Sankar! Since you’re already experienced with systems-level development (and even dabbling in Rust), I’ll tailor this documentation to be more implementation-focused rather than just theoretical. This step-by-step will cover implementing the **Raft consensus algorithm** in a practical way that can eventually be extended to a real distributed system.

# 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the Raft Consensus Algorithm

## 🧱 Prerequisites

- Language: Rust (or Typescript/Node if you prefer—let me know and I’ll adjust).
- Networking: Basic understanding of gRPC or HTTP for inter-node communication.
- Data Structures: Queues, logs, finite state machines.
- Concurrency: Threads, timers, async/await.

---

## 1. **Understand Raft’s Core Components**

Raft has 3 primary responsibilities:

1. **Leader Election**
2. **Log Replication**
3. **Safety & Commit Management**

Each server in Raft can be in one of three states:

- **Leader**
- **Follower**
- **Candidate**

---

## 2. **Define Core Data Structures**

Start by modeling the Raft node state.

```rust
enum Role {
    Leader,
    Follower,
    Candidate,
}

struct LogEntry {
    term: u64,
    command: String, // or Vec<u8> if abstract
}

struct RaftState {
    current_term: u64,
    voted_for: Option<usize>,
    log: Vec<LogEntry>,

    commit_index: usize,
    last_applied: usize,

    role: Role,
    id: usize,
}
```

---

## 3. **Implement Persistent Storage (Optional at First)**

To ensure durability after crashes:

- Store `current_term`, `voted_for`, and `log` to disk.
- For now, you can use in-memory state or `sled` (Rust) or file-based JSON for simplicity.

---

## 4. **Create Network RPCs**

Raft requires these RPCs:

- `RequestVote(term, candidate_id, last_log_index, last_log_term) -> VoteGranted`
- `AppendEntries(term, leader_id, prev_log_index, prev_log_term, entries[], leader_commit) -> Success`

Design these as traits/interfaces, then implement them over your RPC layer (gRPC, HTTP, or even simple TCP).

Example:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait RaftRPC {
    async fn request_vote(&self, args: RequestVoteArgs) -> VoteResponse;
    async fn append_entries(&self, args: AppendEntriesArgs) -> AppendResponse;
}
```

---

## 5. **Implement Leader Election**

- Every node starts as a Follower.
- If no heartbeat received after a timeout (e.g., 150–300ms), transition to Candidate and start an election.
- Send `RequestVote` to all peers.
- Become Leader if you receive majority votes.

Make sure you reset the timer on:

- Receiving AppendEntries
- Granting a vote

---

## 6. **Implement AppendEntries and Heartbeats**

As Leader:

- Send `AppendEntries` periodically to maintain authority (even with empty entries → heartbeats).
- Followers:
  - Check term
  - Validate log matching properties
  - Append new entries if valid
  - Update commit index if `leader_commit` > `commit_index`

---

## 7. **Commit and Apply Log Entries**

Only **committed entries** (majority acknowledged) can be applied to the state machine.

State machine could be a simple key-value store:

```rust
fn apply_to_state_machine(cmd: &str) {
    // parse and apply
}
```

Leader keeps track of:

- `next_index[]` (next log index to send to each peer)
- `match_index[]` (highest log index known to be replicated on each peer)

---

## 8. **Handle Term Changes and Election Safety**

Rules:

- If term in RPC > current_term: convert to Follower.
- Each node grants **only one vote** per term.
- Follower must reject AppendEntries or RequestVote with lower term.

---

## 9. **Cluster Initialization & Recovery**

Set up nodes with a list of peer addresses. Handle restarts by reloading state from persistent storage.

Add command-line args or config files to simulate:

```bash
./raft_node --id 1 --peers 2,3,4,5
```

---

## 10. **Testing and Debugging**

Start with:

✅ Unit tests for:

- Election timeout
- AppendEntries validation
- Log matching

✅ Integration tests:

- 3-node cluster
- Kill Leader and verify re-election
- Network partition & recovery

You can simulate failures by toggling timers and dropping messages.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Add Client Request Handling

Once the cluster is stable:

- Only the **Leader** handles client requests.
- Leader appends the request as a new log entry.
- Wait for majority ACKs.
- Then apply and respond.

---

## 🌐 Optional Next Steps

- Log compaction via **Snapshotting**
- Membership changes (Joint consensus)
- Formal spec testing (Jepsen-style)
- Metrics, observability, Prometheus/Jaeger

Would you like me to scaffold this in Rust with basic networking (using `tokio` and `tonic`) or do you prefer Typescript with Node and WebSocket/gRPC? Let me know and I’ll generate a starter project structure!
